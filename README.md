# ACTIVITY 1 
1. One of the main challenges I faced was that my device didn’t have enough storage space. The file size of Android Studio is quite large, so it took up a lot of memory. Because of that,
   I couldn’t continue the installation on my own laptop. To solve this, I borrowed a classmate’s PC to finish the setup. The downloading process itself was easy since our instructor clearly explained the steps on how to install it properly.

2. Since it was my first time using Android Studio, I learned that an Android app is made up of different parts that work together — like the XML files for the design or layout,
   and the Java or Kotlin files for the app’s functions. I also understood that each project has folders for different components, such as activities, resources, and manifests.
   It helped me realize how apps are built step-by-step and how coding and design are connected inside Android Studio.
